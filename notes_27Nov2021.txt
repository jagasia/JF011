APIs
	are the REST api

service
	create
	read
	read
	update
	delete


each method should be tested using junit test cases


Swagger
	what is the need for swagger?

one of you create a RESTful web service	(rest api)
other member is accessing that REST api
	this member is not aware of what are the methods (URL) available for invoking.

	simply, there is no documentation found for the REST API
		IN THOSE days, when we learned SOAP web service, there was documentation (WSDL)

	but in rest api, there is no documentation.

In order to create documentation for REST api, swagger is introduced.

documentation
	provides the list of operations exposed by the api.		
		operations = methods			methods are exposed using url

Lets see a demo for swagger:
----------------------------
If you already have a REST api:
--------------------------------
	i) add the following dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>

	ii) use the below annotation under @SpringBootApplication (or) @Configuration
@EnableSwagger2

	thats all. Its' done.
		ok. But where is the documentation?????	(go to the URL and append /v2/api-docs)
			http://localhost:8080/book/v2/api-docs
