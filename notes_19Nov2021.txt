Yesterday, we logged into the aws portal.

https://aws.amazon.com/

1) we will learn now, to deploy a spring boot application in aws

	i) create a simple rest api ie., spring boot application with @RestController
	ii) server.port=5000
	iii) generate jar file		
		right click the project 
			run as 
				maven build	
					goals: 		clean install

	same can be done by going to command prompt in the location where pom.xml is present
		mvn -Dclean -Dintall build

2) login to aws portal
	https://aws.amazon.com/

	we are going to deploy the spring boot app in Elastic Beanstalk
		allows us to deploy .jar or .war files directly



	go to elastic beanstalk
		create application
			name: jf011-aws-1
			platform: java
				leave other options as it is

		application code
			sample/your code?	
			upload your code
				and select the jar file from target folder



when i create an application, an environment is also created.
	without environment, an application cannot be run.

if appln name is jf011-aws-1
then the env name will be 
	jf011aws1-env	


the env should be a part of a default VPC
	if required, create default vpc from env itself. That is simple

if RDS ie., relational database service is required, it should be a part of atleast 2 availability zones



		

Creating load balancer failed Reason: Default VPC not found (Service: AmazonElasticLoadBalancing; Status Code: 409; Error Code: InvalidConfigurationRequest; Request ID: 2cbce1b2-0d85-4918-b3ff-264a7b520f55; Proxy: null)


Default VPC not found 
	i have deleted that default vpc earlier. so i am getting this error.
	solution:
		i am going to create it now.
