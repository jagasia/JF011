Once you complete a program or project,
before you hand over, 
find all unnecessary / observation code like System.out.println
and replace the neccessary observation code into log entries (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR)

You can choose same of different pattern for Console and File
File logs to have date and time
Console logs may have date or may not have

You may also have rolling log files with fixed size of file.

These log informations are very useful when we debug. (trace for logical errors)

DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
-------------------------------
	Analysis of algorithms
		Why ds and algo?
			While solving a problem,
			in any program, there are 
				data
				logic


	in any program, (java terms) 
		variables
		methods

	A class has only these 2 things
		variable (or) constants			both are data members
		methods					contains the login ie., algorithm

	even in a simple problem,
		adding 2 numbers

	data: 2 numbers
	algo:	+


	we have algoirthms and datastructures in any program we write. 

	If you know the algorithm and 
	If you choose the right data structure, then
	your problem is solved


Why i say correct datastructure?

	You know? Binary search?
		in dictionary, we search for a "word".
		We do not start searching from the first word to the last word.

		we go to the middle of the book and predict or decide whether our word is in "left" or "right"

	in this way, we eliminate half of the book from searching.


This is called as binary search. 
Imagine, if the dictionary is not in A-Z order. we cannot perform binary search.

So, the binary search algorithm works only on a data structure which is already sorted.

Algorithm can be very effective but only when it is used on appropriate data structure.

Algorithms:
	searching
	sorting
	find the efficiency of algo:
		time complexity
		space complexity

		find the efficiency order of growth.	ie., when the size of the datastructure increases, then how the efficiency of the algorithm varies

		for ex:
			i use linear search. ie., start from first element, search until, found or end is reached
			the efficiency is proportional to the size of the ds.	small list? small amount of time. large list, large amount of time
			that is what the order of growth.

		but not all algorithms are like that. Some algo is efficient surprisingly in a different way
		some algorithms are poor efficient when sorting a list which is in descending order.
		desc order is another way of sorted element. but blindly if we apply bubble sort, it will take maximum time always irrespective of the list being already sorted 

Datastructures:
	Linear
	Non-linear	
-----------------------------------------
Linear
	Array
	LinkedList
	Stack
	Queue

These are linear datastructures
	because, they are linked like 
		1->2->3->4->5->6


	Linear means, there is an order.

If i ask you to tell A-Z

	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

if i ask you what is the 15th alphabet?
	O

that means, our memory is linear. Each alphabet knows what is next


ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA

	now, i am able to do that, because, my memory is double linked list


This is what linked list.

Singly linked list can traverse from first to last only

Doubly linked list can travers from first to last and also from last to first


Arrays
	all of you know arrays.

Why arrays are not sufficient to solve some problems.
Why other datastructures are required.

Limitations of arrays.

Find the difference between various datastructures

	Array
	LinkedList
	Stack
	Queue
