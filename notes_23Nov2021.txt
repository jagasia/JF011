Yesterday, we learned ECR
	Elastic Container Registry
		it is a registry of docker images. Almost simlar to docker hub.

	we created a repository in ecr
	and 
	i created a docker image (it was already there in my local docker images)
	
	login to aws ecr	(command was copied from "Push Commands")
	tag the local image to the repo
	push the image to repo

	all these commands were available in the Push commands. We ignore a command that was used to build an image
	because, we already have the image.


Today, we learn ECS
	Elastic Container Service

	this is also a compute cloud

we need to create a task in ECS.

Elastic Beanstalk	
	we deploy the .jar or .war
ECR
	we push the docker image
ECS	
	we run the docker image

jf011-demo-1

	docker run -p 8083:5000 jf011-demo-1





we learned to create a docker image by
	i) create a Dockerfile 
		and make entries
	ii) in cmd we build the docker image using the Dockerfile

but we can also create a docker image without having a Dockerfile
	2) create a docker image
		mvn spring-boot:build-image



jagindia/jf011-demo-1:latest


steps for EC2:
--------------
1) create a spring boot application
2) create a docker image
	mvn spring-boot:build-image
3) push the image to the docker hub
	i) create repo in hub.docker.com
	ii) tag the local image to repo
	iii) docker push repo
4) go to aws ECS
	create task definition
		choose between "Fargate" or "EC2"
		choose "Fargate"
		enter task definition name
		enter task role as "None"
		enter task memory 1 Gb
		enter cpu memory 0.5v CPU
		create container
			enter name
			image:
				docker.io/jagindia/reponame:tagname
			memory limit: hard limit	1024
			port mapping: 8080 and 80
		click "Add"
		click "create"

	create cluster
		type: Networking only
		cluster name: jag1
		click create
	view cluster
		task
			"Run new task"
				Launch type: fargate
			choose task definition (already created)			
			choose cluster vpc
			choose subnet
			security group:	
				"Edit"
				enter the security group name (any name)
				In bound rules
					choose all traffic and all tcp
		click Run task button
		in the cluster, check logs (refresh)
		view logs in cloud watch

	In status:	
		Last status: RUNNING
	Below that
		Network:
			public IP		(copy the ip address)
	go to browser:
		http://ipaddress:portnumber
