After learning spring REST api,
You may wonder how, we can access this REST api from a MVC Project.

You know how to test a REST api using Postman.

in MVC project, you provide VIEW for the end user to access the application.
They can do CRUD operations using JSP front end.

But the question is how will you access PUT, DELETE mappings from JSP form?????

if i ask you how will you access GET/ POST mappings, you will be able to tell me

@Controller in mvc project	(instead of @RestController)


<form method="GET"		(yes)
<form method="POST"		(yes)
<form method="PUT"		(NO)
<form method="DELETE"		(NO)

you have lot of submit buttons in ONE form

<FORM>
	ADD
	UPDATE
	DELETE
</FORM>



You need a technique to access the REST API URLs from MVC project.
Solution is:
	Feign client

In spring boot projects, we can add "Open Feign" dependency and use @FeignClient annotation to achieve this.

by using feign client,
	you will transform the REST API urls into METHODS of an interface, whose implementation is autowired in the 		controller

	once you autowire that, you can call these rest api methods just like a java method.

I give a demo on how to create MVC project that will access REST API (that we created for Branch entity)
i will have a jsp page for Branch.


Demo:

The REST api is already running in port 8080.
So i am going to create a MVC project that runs in 8081

1) start.spring.io
	or in sts i create spring starter project

	choose the packaging as "war"

2) add dependencies:
	Spring web
	DevTools
	OpenFeign

3) in main application class
	under the 
	@SpringBootApplication

	add the annotation
	@EnableFeignClients


4) Hello world index.jsp all the steps are confirmed
	created the folders under "webapp"
	application.properties 
		
		spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/view/
		spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp

		server.port=8081

5) create an interface and declare the methods of REST api with @FeignClient



========================
How to remove an item from cart

CartController

@Autowired
private CartService cs;



cs.getAllCartItems()
	List<MenuItem> 

	for(MenuItem mi : items)
	{
		if(mi.getName().equals(ri))
		//problem
			ConcurrentModificationException
	}


Whenever we loop a list
	inside the loop, if we remove an item, it will affect the boundary condition and we get the exception.

	so the proper way to remove an item from the list while looping is to USE ITERATOR

List<MenuItem> mitems

it mitems.iterator();

while(it.hasNext())
{
	MenuItem mi=it.next();
	if(mi.getName().equals(ri))
	{	it.remove();			//simple and safe.
		break;
	}
}

now the list is missing one item as required.

this list should be updated to the cart

FOR THAT SERVICE should have a method that will set List to the cart

public class Cart
{
	List<MenuItem> 

	getter
	setter
}




server may have a method to get Cart.

once you get Cart. you can get set the list
