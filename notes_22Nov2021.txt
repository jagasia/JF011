on saturday,
	we created an elastic beanstalk application
	and the environment is configured to have mysql database	RDS	

we created 2 projects in aws
1) REST api		.jar	that connects with RDS and also provides rest controller CRUD
2) MVC project		.war	that provides jsp front end and @Controller	

	the mvc project accessed the rest api using feign client.

Today,
ECR
ECS


ECR
	Elastic Container Registry

		this is almost similar to hub.docker.com		

Docker hub
	where, we deploy the docker images.	Local image becomes remote image. So that anybody from anywhere can run our image (by pulling the image)

pull
	remote image becomes a local image	(copy)

push	
	local image is pushed to docker hub as a remote image

tagname to specify the version of the image				:latest
	:tagname



ECR
	allows us to register the docker images in aws registry.
	what is the use?
		anybody from anywhere can pull the image, run the image in their system	(same as docker hub)

	Docker image is not going to run in AWS server at all. This is passive thing. 
	it will run in our local computer when we pull and run these docker images.



Cloud computing

what are the basic services provided by cloud service providers
	Storage
	Compute
	Networking


i can deploy a java application in cloud. but will it execute and produce output?
the cloud is also provided a runtime environment to produce dynamic output.


Elastic Compute Cloud		EC2

Elastic Beanstalk
Elastic Container Service
	these comes under EC2 because, they are capable of running our code in cloud and produce output

But ECR
	is not under compute. because, it provides space for storing our docker images only. But not run at cloud.



install aws cli

aws configure
(the access key id, secret key can be found in our account dashboard)




C:\Users\rjaga>aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************34UP]: AKIAQN3NBJXVUP
AWS Secret Access Key [****************fJxo]: LFjRlBwWh4YJkkd6ckkvDN3jRiifJxo
Default region name [ap-south-1]: ap-south-1
Default output format [None]: None



Demo:

docker images
	we see there is an image "jf011-demo-1"
	we are going to push this docker image (local image) to ECR

1) create a repository in ECR
	aws ecr create-repository --repository-name jf011-1 --region ap-south-1



docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 029756575211.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com



docker tag jf011-demo-1:latest 029756575211.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/jf011-1:latest
docker push 029756575211.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/jf011-1:latest





029756575211.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/jf011-1:latest

docker run -p 8080:5000 029756575211.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/jf011-1:latest


-----------------------
Task:
	create a local docker image

	create a repo in ECR

	PUSH the local docker image to ECR repo

	run the docker image from ECR

----------------------------------------

ECS
	the image runs in AWS itself.
