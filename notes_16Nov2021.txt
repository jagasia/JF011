Yesterday, we have installed Docker.

in cmd prompt:
	docker --version

now, lets learn Docker

Lets run an application that is already deployed in hub.docker.com

Docker hub
	is a repository where docker images are deployed


so we can run any of those docker images/ repositories in our computer.
in that process, we actually, download docker image to our local image repository

at this moment, lets see in our computer, how many docker images are there?


to get the list of docker images in our system:
	docker images
	(or)
	docker image ls



to remove a docker image from your system	(rmi = remove image)
	docker rmi <<image name>>


when you run a docker image, it becomes a container.

Have you ever heard about "container"

when we learnd servlets, jsp there was something called "web container"

in spring, 	IOC container

all these containers are "Special JVM" (in java)

that provides space, runtime environment, and necessary support for RUNNING the application.

Container is a running instance of the image
---------------------------------------------


to check the list of containers running in our computer:
	docker container ls
	(or)
	docker ps



PLEASE SIGNUP to hub.docker.com


run the below command: (there is a docker image of spring boot application in docker hub. we are going to run that image in our computer now.)

	docker run -p 5000:5000 in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE


docker run
	is the command to run an image (which is present locally or in docker hub)
	if it is not present locally, it will download it as a local image and then only it will run.

-p
	to specify the port in which the application should run.
	first 5000	is to specify our choice of port in our computer
	second 5000	is the port they have specified in their program

	we may ignore the second port number also. Or if you want to find, run without -p switch. in console we can find the port (it may say the port is alreay occupied)


in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
	what is this?
		in hub.docker.com,
			in28min		is the name of an account
			todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE		is the name of repository




Unable to find image 'in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE' locally


docker ps -a
	for listing all docker containers (even if it is running invisibly)

find the docker containers and remove them
	if the container does not allow your to remove, because it is running, we can forcibly remove them
		using 	-f switch

docker rm <<container id>>
docker rm -f <<container id>>

-----------------------
Next level:

we should CREATE a docker image for our own spring boot application

docker run -p 5000:5000 in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
