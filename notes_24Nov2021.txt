to login to aws portal and do the practicals.

from Dec 1st (hopefully)
--------------------------------------------
start cloud learning once again.


learn concepts that will help us in projects

sign up
login
logout

CRUD
	ticket		transportation
	medicine	hospital
	books		education
	product		e-commerce	

whatever the domain may be 
the operations we do are same

------------------
Task:
-----
signup 

sign up is a process where an user registers themselves by filling a form
i) the form will not be submitted, if there are any validation failure.
ii) on successful submission, the application should store a row in the USER_MASTER table

TO DO this task,

you have to 
i) define a table		USER_MASTER
ii) create entity class in java		User.java
iii) UserRepository.java		interface that extends jpa repository
iv) UserService.java			class that autowires the repo
v) UserController.java		
	//for signing up, actually you are adding a row in the user table

	addUser()		could be the method. Or you can name it as signup() method itself


you can proceed to do CRUD methods
	create			//signup
	read
	read			//login			you can name it as login method. SURE
	update
	delete


in future, it may be useful to do password updation or email id change or name change or anything


table should not have confirmpassword as a column.	That is only for front end validation.
