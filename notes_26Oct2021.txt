Hibernate relationships:

@ManyToOne, @JoinColumn, @OneToMany, FetchType.EAGER, FetchType.LAZY, @ManyToMany, @JoinTable, mappedBy


The relationship between entities can be
	1 to Many
	Many to 1
	1 to 1
	Many to Many

Can you tell me the example for 1 to Many?

1 Department Has many Employees

EMPLOYEE
	ID
	FIRSTNAME
	LASTNAME
	DEPARTMENT		object		not department id	
			department_id will be the foreign key
			but in java, Employee  has Department object 

we do not use standard implementation of physical naming

id is the primary key in department table
but in employee table, department_id is the foreign key

_ is good

Any annotation ends with Many, will create a new table. BEcause, we cannot store many values in one row.

1 ECE
	11
	12
	13

how can a department row, provision space for 3 employees????	
	so it will create a new table.
	But already there is a table Employee. So we need to mention that DO NOT CREATE A NEW TABLE, rather, use the existing table.
		mappedBy 		is used to specify that



when a dropdownlist is selected, it will never call the server side script. it can call only the client side script.
like javascript/ jquery

from that jquery/js we can call server side script. THIS is called as AJAX
