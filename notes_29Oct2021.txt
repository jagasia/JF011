Sonar
---------------------------------

Sonar
	is used for analyzing the code quality
	clean when you code
	This is more into white/glass box testing
	whether or not the good practices followed in the code?
		is there any variable 
			declared and unused
			declared and not initialized
		is there any comment
			comments are good. they are used for explanation or self description
			but there are some code, we will comment them out.	They are not good practice.
		a method has multiple return statements
			if(true)
				return 100;
			else
				return 0;

		the if statement does not have {}		bad practice.
	
		If the class does not belong to any package. 	(it is in default package)

		we assign null to an object.
		Then we access the member of the object. (At runtime, we get NullPointerException) Sonar will find it
	What are the code quality metrics
		Bug			errors in the code
		Code smell		code that do not follow good practices
		Code debt		time taken to solve this problem in terms of hours/days/weeks
				
What is the tool we download and install for Sonar?
	Sonar Qube


download sonar qube from:
	https://www.sonarqube.org/success-download-community-edition/

unzip and extract to softwares folder
	
start sonar server:
	in sonar folder, go to bin folder -> windows folder,
	run the StartSonar.bat	script

if your java_home refers to java 8:

	 SonarQube requires Java 11 to run

	in that case, change the env variable
		JAVA_HOME		C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1
		path			C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin

	Now again run StartSonar.bat

go to browser 
	http://localhost:9000

it will prompt you to enter username and password
		admin
		admin

Demo for using sonarqube to analyze the code quality of a core java project (maven)

1) Create a java project
2) Convert to maven project
	right click project
		Configure-> convert to maven project
3) now you got pom.xml
	add the following plugins:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.7.0.1746</version>
</plugin>

<plugin>
	<groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
	<artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>0.8.1</version>
</plugin>



4) clean install the project (any of the following steps)
	i) right click project
		run as -> maven build (first option)
			in the goals:-
				clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install

	ii) go to cmd prompt to the location where pom.xml is present
		mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install


	what happens? the jar/war is created in target folder


5) go to localhost:9000 portal
	this is sonarqube portal

	you have already logged in (admin:admin)
	click "Add Project" in the top right corner
		manually

	type the project name and (display name is automatically typed)

	create token	(type anything)
		continue

	choose "Maven"

		click the copy+ in the right side

i) Run the below command in cmd prompt where pom.xml is present:
mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=jf011-sonarqube-demo-1 -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 -Dsonar.login=9d466306414cebdcf29b112c0b0f9aee854e3126

(or)
ii) Right click the project and run as "Maven Build" (2)
	paste the below code in goals

sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=jf011-sonarqube-demo-1 -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 -Dsonar.login=9d466306414cebdcf29b112c0b0f9aee854e3126
