Query Methods - Search by containing text, sorting, filter with starting text, fetch between dates, greater than or  lesser than, top

jpa repository allows us to write queries using @Query

basically, the queries we write are not SQL statements.
	in sql:	SELECT * FROM Employee		(notice, * for all columns, 	Employee is the table name)
	but
	in jpa:	SELECT e FROM Employee e	(noteice, e if an object(s) of Employee. Employee is not the table name, but the class name. You know, the table name and the class name can be different also)


now, if we want to use SQL language features, like functions,
	we can write NATIVE query

	
public interface CustomerRepository extends JpaRepository<Customer, Integer>
{
	@Query("SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.address=:address")
	public List<Customer> findCustomersByAddress(@Param("address") String address);
	
	@Query(value =  "SELECT * FROM Customer", nativeQuery = true)
	public List<Customer> getAllCustomers();
	
}




	@Query(value =  "SELECT * FROM Customer ORDER BY id DESC", nativeQuery = true)
	public List<Customer> getAllCustomers();


Pagination
-----------
In JSP, i display the records in pages
	i can display page numbers in the bottom with hyperlink
	each page can have fixed number of columns. Last page can have only available rows

query.setMaxRowCount();
query.list();



JPQL		JPA Query Language
HQL		Hibernate Query Language

before these fw, even EJB had
EJBQL		EJB Query Language

All these are java implementation querying.
Because a java programmer is more into java classes and properties than TABLES and COLUMNS

because, if there is an image column, then we can simply add a getter method that returns Encoded string from image
in queries, if we say image, then it is getImage()


@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.status = ?1")
User findUserByStatus(Integer status);


here, ?1 means, the first parameter

?1, ?2, ?3 
these are called as positional parameters

@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.status = :status")
User findUserByStatus(@Param("status") Integer status);

here,
:status is a named parameter

@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.status = :status and u.name = :name")
User findUserByStatusAndNameNamedParams(
  @Param("status") Integer status, 
  @Param("name") String name);



------------
some times we write a query like
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER a WHERE a.address IN (:address)

in this case, :address should be a collection of Strings


@Query(value = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name IN :names")
List<User> findUserByNameList(@Param("names") Collection<String> names);


DML operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

all these operations can be done using query with @Modifying annotation



@Modifying
@Query(
  value = 
    "insert into Users (name, age, email, status) values (:name, :age, :email, :status)",
  nativeQuery = true)
void insertUser(@Param("name") String name, @Param("age") Integer age, 
  @Param("status") Integer status, @Param("email") String email);



@Modifying
@Query(value = "update Users u set u.status = ? where u.name = ?", 
  nativeQuery = true)
int updateUserSetStatusForNameNative(Integer status, String name);


Task:
-----
Create query to return list of entities in descending order
Create native query to do the same
Use Sorted 
Use @Modifying
Use positional parameters
Use named parameters

Maven installation steps:
-------------------------
First check if maven is already installed in your computer or not:
	mvn -v


Usually, when we install a software, 
	some files are stored in the program files. Folders may be created. Desktop shortcuts are created.
	In addition to that, some times, 
		environment variables are also created.


But in case of Maven, we do not get an installer, while we download Maven.
What we download, is a zip file (window OS)

https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.3/source/apache-maven-3.8.3-src.zip

Once you downloaded the zip file.
Extract the zip file contents into a Folder
	C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation
		if you do not find "Apache Software Foundation" folder in c:\program files, CREATE IT



Create the following environment variables:
	M2_HOME		C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.6.3
	M2		%M2_HOME%\bin
	MAVEN_OPTS	-Xms256m -Xmx512m

close the command prompt and open a new command prompt
and check
	mvn -v


if you check JAVA_HOME
